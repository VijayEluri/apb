Provides a set of tasks to handle common operations intended to be use inside APB targets.
Apb tasks are somewhat similar to Ant tasks, but they are intended to be invoked from Java Code.
Tasks follow a fluent based interface.
The common entry point for tasks in this package is the {@link apb.tasks.CoreTasks} class that acts as a factory 
for all the tasks.
